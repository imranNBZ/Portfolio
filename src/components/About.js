        I'm a front-end developer with a passion for crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in building modern interfaces using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and have experience working with tools like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, React Router, and Axios. I also integrate frontend apps with Firebase for authentication and real-time features, and I'm comfortable using version control with Git and GitHub.        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy building both the frontend and backend, working with React, Node.js, Flask, and PostgreSQL.
          My background in healthcare has sharpened my communication, organization, and problem-solving â€” and I apply those skills to code every day.
